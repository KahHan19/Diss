This is my Research Project: Effectiveness of multi-scaling keypoints for Sign Language Translation





The code consist of Three sections The other fold is a adjusted version of Ben Saunders Progressive Transformer to make it DWPose compatible. The code also includes rtmlib from Jiang, Tao (https://github.com/Tau-J/rtmlib) which is cited below, this part of the code is to perform DWPose and draw the skeletal keypoints for the poses. ( Do know that the code was also changed to make it compatible with the assingment ).
