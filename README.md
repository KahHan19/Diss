This is my Research Project: Effectiveness of multi-scaling keypoints for Sign Language Translation





The code consist of Three sections:

Counter_embedding: Add Counter Values in the the skeleton keypoints estimates

DWPose_RTMB: Which is the rtmlib from Jiang, Tao (https://github.com/Tau-J/rtmlib) This part of the code is to perform DWPose and draw the skeletal keypoints for the poses. Do know that the code was also changed to make it compatible with the assingment ).

Proggressive Transformer: Adjusted version of Ben Saunders Progressive Transformer to make it DWPose compatible
